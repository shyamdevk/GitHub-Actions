## 📌 **What is GitHub Actions?**

GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD automation tool** built directly into GitHub.
It helps developers **build, test, and deploy applications automatically** using simple YAML workflows stored in:

```
.github/workflows/
```

Here is your **fully structured, clean, decorated `README.md` section** for:

✔ Workflow
✔ Jobs
✔ Hosted & Self-Hosted Runners
✔ Event-Driven Triggers

Perfect to paste directly into your README.
